A repository for the codes written on calculation of Entropy on classical two dimensional spin lattices.
The method is a simple Monte Carlo simulation accompanied by indirect derivation of entropy from the energy curve. The objective is to obtain residual entropy $T \rightarrow 0 $ value of entropy.
